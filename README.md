# NodeJBD

Utility to retrieve data from JBD/Overkill solar BMS units and publish it to MQTT, written in NodeJS.

Data can then be surfaced in Home Assistant, or anything else that can read from a MQTT bus.

It currently doesn't support all registers, however I will be continuing to add support for them.
