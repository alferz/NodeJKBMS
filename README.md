# NodeJBD

Utility to retrieve data from JBD/Overkill Solar BMS units and publish it to MQTT, written in NodeJS, Based on [NodeRenogy](https://github.com/mickwheelz/NodeRenogy).

Data can then be surfaced in Home Assistant, or anything else that can read from a MQTT bus.

**NOTE: This is still very *alpha* and untested. It does however publish (most) data on register 3 to MQTT**

This readme will be updated when the software is more complete, use at your own risk.
